 I have implemented a Simple Contact Management System to Develop a program that allows users to store and manage contact information. The program has provided options to add a new contact by entering their name, phone number, and email address. It should allow users to view their contact list, edit existing contacts, and delete contacts. The program also stores the contacts in memory.
